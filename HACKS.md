The Google services problem
---------------------------

As is widely known, a custom build on your machine does not comes with google services preinstalled, and merely copying the packages into `/system` will not work.

I still haven't found a good way to integrate google services. For now I only uses self compiled kernel with a "stock" (i.e. installed from official iso) release. If anyone has any idea, please raise an issue.
